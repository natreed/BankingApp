# Bank Account App in Asp.Net Core

This project was developed in response to a request for a code sample for Company 'X'. 
The homework was to create a banking application with a backend implemented in C#.
The task did not require implementing a front end (a CLI would have been sufficient). 
But since I had not worked with asp.net before or played around with database frameworks at all really, 
I thought I might learn something by playing around with the asp.net core framework. 
I think it still checks all the boxes of the requirements as well.

This app only demonstrates basic operations of opening an account, logging in, checking balance, making a deposit or withdrawal, checking transaction
history and logging out. 

I kept the Schema as simple as possible. All data is accessed and updated through the Customer entity.
